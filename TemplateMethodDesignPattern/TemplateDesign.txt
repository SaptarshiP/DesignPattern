The template design pattern is used in this situation when the 
we have created a class for a particular application
that same class with more or less same implementation is used by another application
instead of creating a new class implementation, we can use the old implementation
for that purpose the template(class) is created with abstract method and the class which want to implement it can extend the class and override the method
instead we can have default implementation of the method, the needed method can be overriden.
