The decorator design pattern is used, when a base object is beeing decorated with different type of object
Think an example of designing a pizza store
there are some base pizza
there are some topings above base pizza , which is different for different pizza.
so the base pizaa object is decorated with topings pizza object which becomes a new pizza.
so instead this decorating an object with another object is helpful.
